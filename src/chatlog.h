	Chat Log HUD tab.

	A separate HUD reachable from the ESC menu when connected to a server.
	Displays the global chat history (channel 0) chronologically, preserves
	inline color codes, and lets the user select text with the mouse and copy
	it via Ctrl+C / right-click. The tab is hidden when not connected to a
	server.

	Find-in-chat: Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on macOS) opens a search bar at the top of
	the panel. All matches are highlighted, with the current one painted in
	a brighter color. Enter / F3 / Down advances to the next match, Shift
	with any of those steps backwards. Esc closes the bar.

	Hooks the global text-input pipeline into the chatlog search bar.

	The chat log HUD doesn't use a microui textbox - selection, context
	menu, and the link modal are all hand-rolled here, and the search bar
	follows the same pattern. main.c::text_input() consults these so it
	can route raw UTF-8 characters into the search query buffer only when
	the bar is actually open and we're sitting on the chatlog HUD.

	chatlog_search_active() returns non-zero when the bar is open and
	accepting input; the dispatcher returns early after forwarding so the
	character isn't ALSO interpreted by other consumers downstream.
